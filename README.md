# ExcelAuto
# This script was made as a side-project that I thought would be a good idea to incorporate into my work at my co-op. The data collection process was very tedious and time consuming, so I decided to write this python script.
# It automates the copying from the clipboard and pastes it into an excel file, under specific conditions defined by the user
# The files along with the script are the dependencies and the .whl files for the following libraries used in the script: "openpyxl"  and "pyclip". This is only needed if you need to download the libraries without internet, which was my case. You have to download the python installer offline, use "pip install" in the terminal to install all the .whl and dependency files
